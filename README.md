# GeoAI-Challenge-Estimating-Soil-Parameters-from-Hyperspectral-Images-
Can you predict soil parameters from hyperspectral earth observation data?

The objective of this challenge is to automate the process of estimating the soil parameters, specifically, potassium (K), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), magnesium (Mg) and pH, through extracting them from the airborne hyperspectral images captured over agricultural areas in Poland (the exact locations are not revealed). To make the solution applicable in real-life use cases, all the parameters should be estimated as precisely as possible.
